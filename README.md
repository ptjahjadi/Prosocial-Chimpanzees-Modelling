# Prosocial-Chimpanzees-Models
## Aim
This report aims to predict prosocial tendencies of chimpanzees by developing a generalised linear model. This is the second project of the Modern Applied Statistics (MAST30027) subject at the University of Melbourne.
## Summary
A dataset is given with variables regarding how chimpanzees can enact prosocial behaviour. This report aims to model chimpanzee prosociality by using existing variables from the dataset and creating a generalised linear model. In particular, binomial regression methods are used in this report because there are only 2 possible outcomes to measure prosocial behaviour of chimpanzees: yes and no.
## Guide 
The folder "Visualisations" contains all the necessary visualisations for this report.

"rcode.R" is the code used for this project, while the dataset can be found in "assign2.txt".

The final report can be found in "Statistical Analysis on the Prosocial Experiment of Chimpanzees.pdf".
